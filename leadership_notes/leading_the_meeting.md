Goals of Study Group
--------------------
* The agenda itself is the idea of what the study core idea is... basically make sure everyone is participating in a learning/teaching activity and really, really, really make sure everyone feels like they can and should participate
* Bring together the brilliant minds of the tech industry within Ann Arbor, to be accessible to those who want to learn from them

Prior to the study group meeting
--------------------------------
* Mention food in Meetup online before the Meetup, so people know there is food available (a lot of people don't realize we also have food)
* Send a reminder email in meetup a few days before the actual meetup
* Use Meetup reminder and/or twitter to remind people of the meetup, before the meetup (the week before works well)
* Get a 'regular' to run a group project, if there is one that is happening (those leading the study group need to focus on the study group)
* It might also be useful to review the meetup list of who is attending, and get an idea of first timers from this list

At the study group meeting
--------------------------
Right before the meeting:
* Maybe have a whiteboard ready (ask Pillar liaison before the meeting starts)
* Might also be useful to touch base with Pillar liaison briefly prior to the meeting, in case they have something they needs to talk about before members arrive
* Watch for members who are new to study group and seem a little lost, and catch them right when they walk in, make them feel welcome and see if you can help them figure out what they might want to learn
* Bug our 'regulars' about coming to study group
* Bug our 'regulars' before study group starts and ask what topics they may talk about

Beginning of the meeting:
* Introduce the study group (and yourself!)
* Introduce Pillar liaison and Pillar
* Let people know that there is food available (if Pillar liaison doesn't mention it)
* Mention any topics our 'regulars' will be talking about, and where
* Mention any projects or break out sessions that will be happening on that night
* Mention the study group chat room in gitter.im

During the meeting:
* You should be "working the room", making members feel welcome and helping to connect them with people that can help them, or discuss their topics of interest
	* Try to get experienced devs mingling more with those with less experience
	* Be the liaison/facilitator, not the teacher (Delegate helping newer devs to other experienced devs)
	* Make sure the people that seem shy and new get more of the attention, and get the attention first
	* The main goal is to remove the intimidation
* Remind people there is food again about half way through (this helps get people up and moving, get a break, and get more of the food eaten)

End of the meeting:
* Remind people when we are almost out of time (5-10 before the end of study group, so they can finish up what they are doing and be ready to leave at 8
* Help Pillar keep things clean by helping clean up at the end of the study group

After (and in between) study group meetings
-------------------------------------------
* Continue trying to help the members in between meetings, usually through gitter.im or emails
* Might also be useful to use the "good to see you" feature of meetup, that is sent out in an email after the meetup
* Make sure to schedule the next study group, if you haven't already
